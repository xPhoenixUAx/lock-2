              Commercial Locksmith Services
            </h2>
            <p class="muted">
              Services designed for shops, offices, warehouses and multi-tenant
              buildings — from urgent entry to planned access-system rollouts.
            </p>

            <h3>Typical scenarios</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>After-hours lockouts for retail or offices.</li>
              <li>
                Broken cylinders or multi-point failures on high-usage doors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tenant changes requiring rekeys or master-key adjustments.
              </li>
              <li>New site installs for access control or panic hardware.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our approach</h3>
            <p>
              We prioritise non-destructive entry where possible, then assess
              whether repair or full replacement is the most cost‑effective and
              secure option. For system work we provide site surveys, a written
              specification and phased installation plans to minimise business
              disruption.
            </p>

            <h3>What we deliver</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Emergency and scheduled entry with identity checks and
                documentation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cylinder and mortice lock repairs or supply of heavy‑duty
                replacements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Supply and integration of access control (keypad/fob/remote)
                with user management.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design and implementation of master key suites with restricted
                keying.
              </li>
              <li>
                Panic bar installation, testing and compliance adjustments.
              </li>
              <li>
                Replacement door furniture, closers and reinforced strikes for
                heavy-use entrances.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fast on-site key cutting and temporary keyed-alike solutions
                while permanent work is scheduled.
              </li>
              <li>
                Service-level agreements and planned maintenance packages for
                multi-site clients.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Timeframe & parts</h3>
            <p>
              Typical on-site repairs: 30–90 minutes. System surveys and
              quoting: 1–3 business days. We stock common commercial cylinders,
              high-security cores and panic bar kits for fast replacement.
            </p>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <p>
              For high-traffic doors choose commercial-grade hardware and
              schedule regular maintenance. We can set up quarterly or annual
              checks to reduce sudden failures and keep warranties valid.

            <dl class="faq-list">
              <dt>Will you force a commercial door to gain entry?</dt>
              <dd>
                No — we attempt non-destructive entry first and explain options
                and costs before any forced work.
              </dd>
              <dt>Do you work outside normal hours?</dt>
              <dd>
                Yes — we offer 24/7 emergency attendance for commercial lockouts
                and urgent security issues.
              </dd>
              <dt>Can you integrate with our existing access control?</dt>
              <dd>

              Residential Locksmith Services
            </h2>
            <p class="muted">
              Help for homeowners, landlords and tenants — rapid access, smart
              lock installs, and security upgrades tailored to domestic needs.
            </p>

            <h3>Common situations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Locked out of house or flat (non-destructive entry preferred).
              </li>
              <li>
                Lost or stolen keys requiring immediate rekey or lock change.
              </li>
              <li>
                Upgrading ageing cylinders to anti-snap / anti-bump standards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Smart lock installation for keyless access and remote control.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step-by-step service</h3>
            <p>
              We confirm identity where required, explain entry options and only
              proceed with your approval. For replacements we discuss cylinder
              grades, demonstrate the new hardware and complete a functional
              test before leaving.
            </p>

            <h3>Parts & expected times</h3>
            <p>
              Simple entries: 20–45 minutes. Cylinder replacement: 30–60
              minutes. Smart lock installs: 45–120 minutes depending on wiring.
              We fit anti-snap cylinders, reinforced strike plates and tidy
              finishes.
            </p>

            <h3>Advice</h3>
            <p>
              For rental properties schedule rekeys between tenancies and
              consider restricted keying for multi-property managers. Combine
              cylinder upgrades with strike/hinge reinforcement for best
              protection.

            <dl class="faq-list">
              <dt>How quickly can you get me back in?</dt>
              <dd>
                Typical non-destructive entries take 20–45 minutes; we
                prioritise urgent calls.
              </dd>
              <dt>Will a smart lock work on my door?</dt>
              <dd>
                We check mechanical compatibility first — multipoint gearboxes
                or poor alignment can cause failures; we advise before
                installing.
              </dd>
              <dt>Do upgrades meet insurance requirements?</dt>
              <dd>
                We recommend and fit insurance‑approved cylinders and provide

	              replacement options.
	            </p>

	            <h3>After-hours notes</h3>
	            <p>
	              After-hours and emergency rates may apply depending on the time and

	            <p class="muted">
	              Rapid repairs and durable replacements to keep shops and retail
              premises open and secure with minimal disruption to trade.
            </p>

            <h3>Typical problems</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Doors sticking or failing to engage multi-point locks after
                settling.
              </li>
              <li>Panic bar failure or misalignment preventing safe egress.</li>
              <li>
                Glass/door damage from forced entry needing immediate boarding.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our process</h3>
            <p>
              We triage on arrival: secure the premises if needed, then decide
              between alignment/repair or full hardware replacement. For
              businesses we can provide temporary boarding and schedule
              permanent works at a convenient time.
            </p>

            <h3>Typical fixes & timing</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Door realignment and closer adjustment: 30–90 minutes.</li>
              <li>
                Panic bar repair or replacement: 30–120 minutes depending on
                door type.
              </li>
              <li>
                Boarding & temporary security: immediate, followed by permanent
                repair within an agreed timescale.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We can also fit auto-door mechanisms and specialist hinges for
              very high-traffic entrances, and provide staggered repair plans to
              minimise trading interruptions.
            </p>

            <h3>Customer notes</h3>
            <p>
              If a forced entry has occurred we recommend documenting damage for
              insurers and arranging secure boarding immediately; we can assist
              with photos and a written handover.
            </p>
            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <dl class="faq-list">
              <dt>Can you board a shop and allow trading?</dt>
              <dd>
                Yes — we provide neat temporary boarding and can implement a
                short-term fix to allow trading until permanent repairs are
                carried out.
              </dd>
              <dt>How fast can you repair a panic bar?</dt>
              <dd>
                Minor adjustments or latch replacements are often same-day; full
                replacements depend on door type and parts availability.

            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <p>
              We follow a clear procedure: verification of authorised
              instructions, immediate securing (if necessary), then planned lock
              changes. We provide written notes and photos for records and can
              supply new keys sealed in labelled packs for the client or agent.
            </p>

            <h3>Timing & records</h3>
            <p>
              Emergency securing and boarding: immediate. Full rekey or
              replacement depending on property size: 1–3 hours. We supply a
              brief report documenting actions taken, parts used and keys handed
              over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additional eviction services include mailbox and gate lock
              changes, padlock replacements for yards, and secure labelling of
              delivered key sets for audit purposes.

                  <dt>Do you need written authorisation?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Yes — we act only on verified instructions from authorised
                    agents or owners and record the chain of custody.
                  </dd>
                  <dt>How are keys delivered after rekeying?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    We label and seal key sets with client details and provide a
                    short handover certificate.
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Can you change mailbox/gate locks too?</dt>

            </ul>

            <h3>What to expect</h3>
            <p>
              We inspect the safe and advise on likely outcomes and cost before
              attempting work. Many domestic safes can be opened without
              drilling; larger or bespoke units sometimes require graduated
              techniques. We always document the process and offer repair or
              replacement options afterwards.
            </p>

            <h3>Timing</h3>
            <p>
              Minor non-destructive jobs: 1–3 hours. Complex or destructive
              openings: may require a full day and follow-up repairs. We carry
              common replacement lock units and parts for many manufacturers.
            </p>
            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <dl class="faq-list">
              <dt>Can my safe be opened without drilling?</dt>
              <dd>
                Often — many domestic safes are opened non-destructively; we
                advise after inspection.
              </dd>
              <dt>Do you handle contents securely?</dt>
              <dd>
                Yes — we use tamper-evident bags and provide a signed checklist
                for any items handled.
              </dd>
              <dt>How long will repairs take after opening?</dt>
              <dd>
                Small repairs same-day; complex repairs or parts orders may
                require follow-up visits.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              We also offer combination-recovery services, secure handling of

            <ul>
              <li>

            <h3>Inspection & maintenance</h3>
            <p>
              We test release force, door alignment and panic-bar operation.
              Regular maintenance prevents failures and ensures egress remains
              reliable; we offer scheduled inspections and rapid repair visits
              if a device is reported faulty.
            </p>

            <h3>Installation notes</h3>
            <p>
              Correct fitting often requires door reinforcement or astragal
              adjustments; we assess the door and recommend the right device
              (rim, vertical rod or surface-mounted) for durability and
              compliance.
            </p>
            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <dl class="faq-list">
              <dt>How often should panic bars be tested?</dt>
              <dd>
                We recommend annual inspections for high-use doors and immediate
                checks after any reported fault.
              </dd>
              <dt>Can you upgrade existing bars to meet codes?</dt>
              <dd>
                Yes — we assess current fittings and recommend compliant
                replacements where necessary.
              </dd>
              <dt>Do you provide certification?</dt>
              <dd>
                We can issue a simple test certificate and keep records for
                audits on request.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              We keep common spare parts and can convert devices between rim and
              vertical-rod styles if a building layout changes, helping to
              future-proof installations.
