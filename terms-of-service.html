          <p>
            By accessing and using the Locksmith Services website and services,
            you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this
            agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not
            use this service.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Services Description</h2>
          <p>
            Locksmith Services provides locksmith services including, but not
            limited to emergency lockout assistance, lock repairs and
            replacements, lock upgrades, uPVC door and window lock work,
            boarding and burglary repairs, security checks, and master key
            systems. All services are subject to availability and may vary based
            on location, project scope, and other factors.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Estimates and Pricing</h2>
          <p>
            We provide estimates for requested work when possible. Estimates are
            based on the information provided at the time of consultation and
            may be subject to change based on actual site conditions, changes in
            scope, unforeseen complications, and other factors. Final pricing
            will be confirmed before work begins. All prices are in U.S. dollars
            unless otherwise stated.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
          <p>
            Payment terms will be specified for the work performed. Generally: a
            deposit may be required to secure your service or appointment;
            progress payments may be required for larger jobs; final payment is
            due upon completion and acceptance of work. We accept cash, check,
            and major credit cards. Late payments may be subject to interest
            charges as permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Project Timeline</h2>
          <p>
            We strive to complete all work within the estimated timeframe.
            However, timelines are estimates and may be affected by
            availability, material supply, access conditions, unforeseen
            complications, and changes in scope. We will communicate any
            significant delays promptly and work with you to minimize
            inconvenience.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Warranties</h2>
          <p>
            We provide warranties on workmanship and materials as specified at
            the time of service. Warranty claims must be made within the
            applicable warranty period. Normal wear and tear, damage from
            misuse, or modifications made by others are not covered.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Client Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            As a client, you are responsible for providing accurate information,
            ensuring safe access to the work area, making timely decisions,
            protecting personal belongings, and making payments according to the
            agreed terms.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, Locksmith Services'
            liability for any claims arising from our services is limited to the
            total amount paid for the specific service giving rise to the claim.
            We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
            damages, loss of use or enjoyment, damage to personal property not
            directly caused by our negligence, or delays due to circumstances
            beyond our reasonable control.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            In the event of a dispute, we encourage open communication to
            resolve issues amicably. If a dispute cannot be resolved through
            direct communication, we will work in good faith to find a mutually
            acceptable solution and may recommend mediation before pursuing
            legal action. Any legal proceedings shall be conducted in the
            jurisdiction of the registered office of the Website Operator.
